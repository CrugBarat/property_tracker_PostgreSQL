# Property Tracker

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

**Brief**

Make a table for tracking properties for sale and let. An entry in the properties table must have a selection of 4 of these properties:

- address
- value
- number of bedrooms
- year built
- buy/let status
- square footage
- build

Your property class should have:
- Full CRUD functionality
- The ability to find properties by id
- The ability to find properties by address
